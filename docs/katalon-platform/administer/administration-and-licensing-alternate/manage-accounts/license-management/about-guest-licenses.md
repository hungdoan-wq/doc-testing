title: About Guest Licenses
---


<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">A Guest License is designed to offer view-only access to specific components of <span className="ph">Katalon TestOps</span>, catering to users who primarily need insight rather than direct interaction with test execution or configuration.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">With a Guest License, users have limited access to <span className="ph">Katalon TestOps</span> features, specifically enabling you to:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">View the <a className="xref" href="/katalon-testops/manage-reports-and-analytics/about-the-project-dashboard">Dashboard</a> page for an overview of test operations.</li><li className="li">Access the <a className="xref" href="/katalon-testops/manage-reports-and-analytics/about-all-reports">Reports</a> module to review generated reports.</li></ul> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This license type allows for broader visibility across projects without granting edit permissions, making it ideal for stakeholders and other external viewers who require monitoring capabilities but do not actively participate in testing activities. A single user can act as a Guest across multiple accounts, organizations, or projects, providing consistent visibility and reporting access wherever needed.</p>
