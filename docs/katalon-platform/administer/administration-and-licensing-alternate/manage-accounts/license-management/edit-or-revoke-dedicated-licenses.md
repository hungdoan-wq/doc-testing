This document shows you how to edit number of dedicated licenses given to organization or revoke them.

A dedicated license is a fixed number of licenses allocated to a specific Organization, limiting how many licenses that Organization can use and manage. Refer to this document to learn more about [Dedicated License](/katalon-platform/administer/administration-and-licensing-alternate/manage-accounts/license-management/assign-dedicated-licenses).

:::tip requirements
You must be assigned the **Account Admin** role to perform this action.

## Edit Dedicated Licenses

3. Hover over the Edit icon (pen icon) of the organization you want to edit the dedicated license for.

4. You can increase or decrease the initial license amount:
    For example, if your account has 200 TestOps licenses and you've assigned 5 to an Organization (with 4 already in use):
    - Increasing adds more licenses to the Organization from the Account-level pool (e.g., from the remaining 195).
    - Decreasing reduces the Organization’s allocation:
        - You cannot reduce below the number currently in use.
        - Setting the value to 0 revokes all dedicated licenses from the Organization, including **those in use**.
5. Click **Save** to proceed.
