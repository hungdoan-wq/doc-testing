## Invite users to join an Organization
To work with your team on a project, start by adding them to your Organization.

Follow these steps to add users to your Organization:

1. Sign in to [TestOps Admin](https://my.katalon.com/) and select your desired Account.
2. In your Account admin page, select your Organization.

3. Select **Users** to open the **User Management** page. Click the **Invite Users** button at the top right corner.

4. Before you perform this step, we highly suggest that you plan which group of users you want to assign specific licenses and teams to.

    On the **Invite Users to Organization** window, enter your user's email address. Then, click **Next**.
    You can enter multiple email addresses to invite multiple users at once (separate by commas).

5. On the **Team and Licenses**  window, assign teams and licenses to your users.

            In case your Organization have no team, you can create a new team by clicking Create a team. Refer to the following topic for the next steps: [Create a Team](/katalon-platform/administer/administration-tasks/manage-projects-and-teams/set-up-teams#create-a-team).
            
            <img src="https://docs.katalon.com/505be2c0-6650-11ee-bc04-0242c7a41fd4/KT-Oct09-Invite_to_Team.png.png" alt="Add users to 1 or multiple team" width="600" />
    
        b. In **Select licenses** section, select the type of licenses you wish to award to your users. You can change these settings later in the **License Management** section.

6. When you're done, click **Confirm**.
#### Result
- If the email domain of the invited users is not a public one (e.g., `@gmail.com`) and matches the email domain of either the Account/Organization Owner or the inviter, the invited users will promptly become active users of your Organization.

- In contrast, other users will receive an invitation email to join your organization. Once these users accept your invitation, they then become users of your Organization.

    You can track their pending invitations in **Pending Invitation** section. You can also refer these users to view this topic for more information: [Join a TestOps Organization](/katalon-platform/administer/administration-tasks/join-an-organization).

**Note**: In case your invited users have not received the email, make sure that they check their spam inbox or ensure that the Katalon Platform email address is whitelisted.

## Manage users
After inviting new users to your Organization successfully, the Owner or Admin can manage their users on the **User Management** page. The following guide shows you how to manage users and pending invitations.

You then can view the list of all existing users.

Once your team members have accepted the invitations to join your Organization, you will see their full names, emails, roles, the dates they joined your organization, their license access, and their most recent access to the organization in the **Active Users** section.

You can update their permissions by changing their roles.
