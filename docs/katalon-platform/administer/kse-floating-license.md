title: "KSE Floating License"
---

Katalon Studio Enterprise (KSE) floating licenses provide a flexible, concurrent licensing model for teams that need to share access to KSE across time zones. The floating model reduces administrative overhead, maintains compliance through traceable seat enforcement, and complements existing seat-based licenses so organizations can mix both types within one account.

## Benefits

- Reduce setup and account maintenance work for large organizations.
- Share the same license pool across time zones and departments.
- Enforce compliance automatically through concurrent seat monitoring.

## How floating licenses work

- Floating seats are centrally managed in Katalon TestOps License Management.
- A seat is allocated when a user launches KSE and signs in via SSO.
- The seat returns to the pool automatically when the user closes KSE, signs out, or their session times out.

This approach optimizes license costs by letting multiple users run KSE at different times without purchasing a seat for each individual.
