## Delete your User Profile

:::caution Important
Deleting your user profile deactivates your Katalon account. You will no longer be able to sign in to any Katalon applications with this profile. This action cannot be undone.

Before you can delete your profile, Katalon checks whether you are a **Primary Account Admin** in any of your Accounts.

- If you are a Primary Account Admin, you must first transfer the Primary Account Admin role to another user before continuing. 
   - To transfer the Primary Account Admin role, contact **support@katalon.com**, or 
   - You can choose to delete the associated account. Refer to this [*Delete an Account* documentation](/katalon-platform/administer/administration-and-licensing-alternate/manage-accounts/account-general#delete-an-account) for details.
- If you are not a Primary Account Admin in any Account, you can proceed with the deletion flow.
