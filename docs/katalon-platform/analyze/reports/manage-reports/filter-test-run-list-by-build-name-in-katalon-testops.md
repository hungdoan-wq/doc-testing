In Katalon TestOps, you can filter Test Runs by Build name to:

- Find and track the list of Test Runs linked with specific Build names.
- Monitor testing progress linked with those Builds.

## Add Build name in Command Line or Console Mode
1. Open Command prompt.
2. Find the Command Line option `--info -buildLabel` and edit it with your own info.

    You can find it in this list of [katalonc command options](/katalon-studio/execute-tests/katalon-runtime-engine/command-line-syntax-in-katalon-runtime-engine).
