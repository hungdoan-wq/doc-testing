## Overview

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The <span className="ph uicontrol">Local Test Environment</span> report allows you to check:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">The number of online and offline agents.</li><li className="li">The distribution of all agents by the operating system.</li></ul>

## Insights

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">With auto-distributed executions in <span className="ph">Katalon TestOps</span>, you can run   tests in parallel. See: <a className="xref" href="/katalon-platform/execute/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/auto-distributed-executions">Auto-distributed     execution</a>.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">A test execution is distributed to an available and active   agent, minimizing execution time. By knowing the number of offline   agents (and in which operating system there are more inactive   agents), you can find out which agents need more jobs, optimizing   testing performance across all platforms by ensuring that all   agents are executing tests.</p>
