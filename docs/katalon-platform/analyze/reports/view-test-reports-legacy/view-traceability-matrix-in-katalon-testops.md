# View traceability matrix in Katalon TestOps

Katalon TestOps offers a complete presentation on traceability with the **Traceability Matrix** report.

You can view test cases, defects, and requirements in one central location, making it easier to manage the relationship across requirements, test cases, and defects.

In Katalon TestOps, the **Traceability Matrix** feature allows you to:

- Manage your project effectively with Jira integration.
- Manage Defects linked to Jira bugs for faster debugging.
- Manage Test Cases linked to Jira issues to track **Requirements** from production through deployment.

Follow these steps:

1. Enable Jira integration. See: [Jira Settings](/katalon-platform/integrations/jira-integration/enable-testops---jira-integration-for-test-management).
2. [Link Test Cases to Jira Requirements](/katalon-platform/integrations/jira-integration/link-test-cases-to-jira-requirements).
3. [Link Test Results to Jira Defects](/katalon-platform/integrations/jira-integration/link-test-runs-to-jira-defects-in-katalon-testops).
4. Go to **Reports** > **Requirements** > **Traceability Matrix**.

The relationship between **Test Cases**, **Defects** and **Requirements** is visible on the report here.

You can map and track all **Requirements** in **Traceability Matrix**. It consolidates requirements and the project's results for production review.
