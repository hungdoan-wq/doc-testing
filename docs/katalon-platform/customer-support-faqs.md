## How long does it take for Customer Support to respond?

We address your support needs according to the severity level.

- **Critical** - A critical issue completely disrupts the core functionality of the Katalon product, resulting in a significant impact on business operations. No viable workaround is available.
- **Major** -  A major issue significantly affects the core functions of the product. While it disrupts normal usage, the product remains operational through available workarounds.
- **Minor** - A minor issue causes limited degradation in functionality but does not impact the core capabilities of the product. Workarounds are available, and the product remains usable.
- **Cosmetic** - A cosmetic issue has negligible impact on functionality and does not affect the usability or performance of the product. These are typically visual or UI-related concerns.

Response time refers to how quickly we acknowledge your support request, assign it to a support engineer, and begin the initial assessment in terms of business hours. This timing starts once you report the issue to us.

We make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the response time (in business hours) and the type of support that comes with your Katalon subscription. Refer to the timetable below:

| Severity | Standard - Monthly Subscription | Standard - Annual Subscription | Premium - Annual Subscription |
|----------|----------| ----------|----------|
| Critical | 8 hours  | 4 hours   | 1 hour   |
| Major    | 16 hours | 8 hours   | 2 hours   |
| Minor    | 24 hours | 12 hours  | 4 hours   |
| Cosmetic | 24 hours | 24 hours  | 8 hours   |

Support will be able to troubleshoot and assist you with your issues provided that request has the following important information in English (as outlined in the [Support Portal case](/katalon-platform/customer-support-faqs#how-to-submit-a-support-case)):
- A detailed description of the issue.
- Execution logs, error logs, and test artifacts.
