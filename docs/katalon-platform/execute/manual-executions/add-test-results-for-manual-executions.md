## Add comments to your test run

This functionality streamlines communication with team members by allowing you to raise questions, notify stakeholders of blockers, and maintain resolution discussions in context, preventing the delays typically caused by communication breakdowns during testing workflows.

Add a comment by going to the text box at the right side of the screen and typing your comment. Then, click **Add**. Your comment is saved in the **Activities** tab.
