View all your executions or apply filters to find the test run you need easily from **Executions**.

1. Go to **Execution**. The Execution List appears by default. It displays all your test runs in a list, including completed and running executions with details, status, start time, and duration.
2. Enter search parameters to filter for specific test runs. You can:
- **Search**: allows you to match text to the name of your test run.
- **Input dates**: allows you to limit the time frame based on when the test run was executed.
- **Select status**: allows you to filter for test runs based on their execution status.
- **Select type**: allows you to filter for manual or automated test cases. 
- **Select executor**: allows you to filter test runs based on the user who executed it.
