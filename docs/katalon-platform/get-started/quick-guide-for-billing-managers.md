## Check your Katalon licenses
:::warning requirements
Make sure you are assigned as an **Account Admin** to view your account's license details.

Or, for a detailed view of all your current licenses: Click on **Manage Licenses**

<img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-platform/get-started/license-management.png" alt="License management TO page" /> <br/>

- **Dedicated Licenses**: These licenses are exclusively assigned to a specific Account or Organization. They can be further distributed to sub-Organizations or individual Users.
    
    If licenses are not marked as Dedicated, any user within the Account can access and use them freely.
- **Pool Licenses**: This refers to the number of licenses remaining after subtracting those assigned to direct sub-Organizations. If no licenses are dedicated to sub-Organizations, the Pool equals the total number of Dedicated licenses.
- **Available Licenses**: These are licenses that have not yet been assigned to any sub-Organization or user.

## Payment Method
:::warning requirements
Make sure you are assigned as an **Account Admin** to manage your account's payment.
:::
Katalon offers 2 payment methods to pay your bill:

- Bank Transfer
- Credit Card

### Bank transfer payment

Katalon supports Bank Transfers through both ACH credit transfer and wire transfer. When you place an order using the Bank Transfer option, you will receive payment instructions that include all the necessary information to complete the transaction.

Important: Please ensure that your transfer amount covers all bank fees so that Katalon receives the full amount as stated on the order. Any shortfall due to bank charges may delay the processing of your order.

The payment deadline for any order is set at 7 days from the date of your order placement. Katalon will activate your subscription as soon as the payment is completed. If Katalon does not receive any payment by the end of the 7th day, your order will be automatically canceled. If the order is canceled but you still wish to make your purchase, you will have to place your order again.

If you pay the renewal fee via Bank Transfer, you will receive *a reminder email* 7 days before the renewal date (or expiry date), providing details about your upcoming renewal with a payment instruction. On the renewal date, if you have not completed your renewal amount, your subscription will expire and be terminated. You then get a confirmation email for the cancellation.

- Payment may take 1-3 business days to reach Katalon's bank account. It must be received by the due date to avoid any order cancellation.
- You can make either a single payment or multiple partial payments within 7 days, but make sure the total sums match the total invoice amount.
- You cannot place a new order until you settle the outstanding balance of your pending payment.

For further assistance, please contact our self-serve team via [billing@katalon.com](mailto:billing@katalon.com).

### Credit card payment

Katalon supports Credit Card payment. You can only use **one card** in each Account for all your subscription purchases, including renewals.

When you place an order with a credit card, you will receive a confirmation email once your payment is successful, and Katalon will activate your subscription instantly.

- If you pay the renewal fee with your Credit Card, you will receive *a reminder email* 7 days before the renewal date (or expiry date), providing details about your upcoming renewal.
    - On the renewal date, your credit card will be charged the renewal fee.
    - In case of a payment failure, the system will offer a 7-day period from the renewal date, you will be notified to update your payment details within this period. Make sure the payment is completed within this 7-day period; otherwise, your subscription will be terminated until a successful payment is made.

The following is a guide on how to manage your card information.

### Update new credit card information

In Katalon TestOps, you can only save **one card** in each organization. If you want to replace your credit card, follow these steps to update your card information:

1. Go to the [purchase.katalon.com](http://purchase.katalon.com/), click **Payment & Billing** tab,
2. Choose **Card** as **Payement Method**
3. Click **Update**.
4. Enter your new payment information, then click **Save**. The new card is now used by default for all billing purposes, including subscription renewals.

    <img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-platform/get-started/update-card.png" alt="Purchase page update credit card" width="900"/> <br/>

### Delete an existing credit card
:::info notes
- You cannot undo this action. Once you delete the card, it is permanently removed from your organization.
- Once you delete the card, Bank Transfer is **automatically** set as the **default** payment method.
:::
Follow these steps to delete an existing credit card:

1. Go to the [Purchase - Katalon Studio](http://purchase.katalon.com/) , click **Payment & Billing** tab
    
2. Click **`...`** icon, then choose **Delete**

## Subscription Management

:::warning requirements
Make sure you are assigned as an **Account Admin** to manage your account's payment.
:::
### View renewal date

Renewal dates for Katalon subscriptions vary depending on the purchase date of each subscription. Your subscription will automatically renew on the expiry date.

Go to the [purchase.katalon.com](http://purchase.katalon.com/), click **Payment & Billing** tab. The renewal date for each subscription will show as: 
`Status: Auto renews on July 29, 2025`

<img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-platform/get-started/check-renew.png" alt="Purchase page subs details" width="900"/> <br/>

### Cancel your subscription:

If you cancel your subscription before the expiry date, you will not be charged for your next billing cycle and will continue to use the subscription until the end of its expiry date.

Subscription cancellation **does not issue a refund** and the subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period.

1. Go to the [purchase.katalon.com](http://purchase.katalon.com/).
2. Click **Payment & Billing** tab.    
3. Turn off the Auto-renew on **toggle** for the subscription you want to cancel.
4. A confirmation popup will appear. Click **Turn off** to proceed.

    **Note:** You can also reactivate your subscription if it has not reached the expiry date yet.

<img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-platform/get-started/turn-off-renew.png" alt="Purchase page turn off renew" width="900"/> <br/>

### Add more session or license to your Katalon subscription

You can upgrade your subscription at any time. Upgrading your subscription does not require you to cancel your existing subscription.

Your account will be upgraded immediately upon successful payment of the **prorated** amount. Any new license or session you add will **co-term with your existing subscription end date**.

For example, if your subscription ends on **Jan 1, 2026**, and you add licenses in **July 2025**, you'll only pay a **pro-rated amount** for the period from July 2025 to Jan 1, 2026—not for a full year.
