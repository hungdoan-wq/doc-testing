<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">To start collaborating and testing with your team with <span className="ph">Katalon TestOps</span>, begin by <a className="xref" href="/katalon-testops/administration-and-licensing/manage-organizations/user-management/add-users-to-an-organization">inviting users into your Organization</a>.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">They will hold the <a className="xref" href="/katalon-testops/administration-and-licensing/about-administration#concept-9094">User role</a> -- which has minimal permissions -- until you reassign them a new one. </p> 
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"><ul className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p"><a className="xref" href="/katalon-testops/administration-and-licensing/manage-organizations/user-management/edit-a-users-account-roles">Assign a User Account Roles</a>: These roles are best for operational administrators who need access to features related to Account management, licensing management, User and permission management, or system configurations.</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p"><a className="xref" href="/katalon-testops/administration-and-licensing/manage-organizations/user-management/edit-a-users-project-roles">Assign a User Project Roles</a>: These roles are best for testers who have to set up general Project settings, configurations, or integrations, or have to use features in TestOps that have to do with the actual testing process. </p></li></ul></div>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">We recommend beginning with this step as defining your Admins and user roles early helps mitigate issues later on. It ensures proper access to important information for all users in the Account while maintaining necessary security measures.</p>
