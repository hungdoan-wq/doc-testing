This document shows you how to set up an integration for Jira within Katalon TestOps.

## Connect a Jira account to TestOps

You must have the **Account Admin** or **System Admin** role to perform this action.

To set up the connection:  
1. Go to **Admin Settings**. (You can find Admin Settings in the upper right corner of the page.)  
2. Navigate to **System > Integrations**, then click **+ Create Integration**.

3. In the **Available Integration** list, choose **Jira**. ✅ A green check mark indicates that the integration is currently available.

4. Fill in the required fields to establish the connection. Katalon TestOps supports **two types** of Jira instances:
    ### 1. Jira Cloud or Atlassian.com (SaaS)
    - **Integration Name**: A custom name for the integration (max 50 characters).  
    - **Organization URL**: The Jira Organization URL.  
        - Example: `https://katalon-product-demo.atlassian.net`  
        - Must start with `https://`  
    - **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Enter your Jira PAT. To generate a PAT, refer to this [documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html). Please make sure the PAT has required permissions.
    <details> 
        <summary> ✅ **Jira Permissions Required for Katalon TestOps Integration** </summary>
        | **Integration Feature** | **Required Permission(s)** | **Notes** |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | **Manual Sync** | `Browse Projects` | Allows TestOps to retrieve project data from Jira. |
        | **Link Defects** | `Browse Projects` | Enables linking Jira issues to TestOps test cases. |
        | **Create Defects** | `Browse Projects`, `Create Issues` | Additional permissions may be required depending on Jira field configurations (see below). |
        |  | *Optional:* `Assign Issues`, `Modify Reporter`, `Link Issues`, `Resolve Issues`, `Schedule Issues` | These become **required** if the corresponding fields (`Assignee`, `Reporter`, `Issue Links`, `Fix Versions`, `Due Date`) are marked as **required** in Jira. |
        | **Handle Webhook Events** | `Browse Projects` | Needed to associate Jira events with TestOps updates. |
        | **Webhook Setup** | `Administer Jira` (global permission) | Required only when configuring webhooks from Jira to TestOps. |
    </details>
    - **Description (Optional)**: Brief description of the integration (max 255 characters).  

    🔁 Service Hooks will be automatically created at the project level for real-time syncing and automation.

    ### 2. Jira Datacenter Server or Self-Managed (On-Premise)
    :::tip TIPS
    - **Supported Version**: Jira Datacenter Server 10.6.1 and above. Older versions may not be fully compatible with TestOps and could cause connection issues.
    - **Use HTTPS for Jira Data Center**: If your Jira Data Center instance uses HTTP, modern browsers will block or auto-upgrade those requests to HTTPS. If the server doesn’t support HTTPS, embedded resources (images, icons, videos) will fail to load. We strongly encourage switching your Jira DC server to HTTPS and updating its base URL. This ensures secure communication and allows all embedded resources in TestOps to load properly.
    :::
    - Fill in the same fields as listed above (Integration Name, Organization URL, PAT, and optional Description). 
        - TestCloud Tunnel (optional). See [Local testing with TestCloud in TestOps](/katalon-testcloud/local-testing-with-testcloud/local-testing-with-testcloud-in-testops) for steps to install the agent, generate tunnel, and manage tunnel availability.

5. Click **Test Connection** to validate the integration.  
6. Once validated, click **Save**, or click **Cancel** to exit without saving any changes.

#### Result

To verify if the connection is active, navigate to **Admin > System > Integrations**. Your Jira integration will be listed under the **Integration list**.  
- If the status initially shows as **Inactive**, reload the page to update the status to **Active**.  
- If the status shows **Error**, verify all required configuration fields, especially the Personal Access Token (PAT), and confirm it is valid and configured correctly in the account-level integration.

    #### Step 3: Release and Sprint Mapping
    :::caution note
    This step is enable only if **Pull Requirements and/or Bug Mapping is selected** (Step 2)
    :::
    In this step, you define how Release and Sprint data will be mapped from your Jira project.

    Note: **Sprint** will be disable if no board is selected (Step 1). 
    <img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-platform/integration/alm/jira-step3.png" alt="Filling in required fields in System Integration UI" width="900"/> <br/>

    #### Step 4: Common Fields and Values Mapping
    :::caution notes
    This step is enable only if **Pull Requirements and/or Bug Mapping is selected** (Step 2)
    :::
    This section allows you to map priority for effective issue prioritization and resource allocation, ensuring clear prioritization based on urgency (e.g., High, Medium, Low). Consistent mapping helps maintain workflow efficiency and prevents misalignment that could lead to inefficiencies.

    Map **Jira Priority** levels your chosen **TestOps Priority** levels based on your workflow.

    #### Step 5: Requirement Fields and Value Mapping
    :::caution notes
    This step is enable only if **Pull Requirements and/or Bug Mapping is selected** (Step 2)
    :::
    This section allows you to select up to three date fields to set the Release Date, with the system using the first available date in your order of selection. You can also set an Jira State's equivalent TestOps Status.

    - **Release Date for Requirement** (Optional): Select three Jira fields as potential sources for the release date of a requirement. These fields are used **in a priority order (left to right)** to determine the release date:
        - Field 1 (e.g., Fix Version Date): This is the **highest priority** field. The system will first check if this date is available for the work item. If it is, this will be used as the release date.
        - Field 2 (e.g., Sprint End Date): If Field 1 is not available or empty, the system will fall back to this second-priority field to determine the release date.
        - Field 3 (e.g., Resolved Date): If both Field 1 and Field 2 are unavailable, the system will use this third-priority field as the release date.
    - Map **Jira Status** to your chosen **TestOps State**

    - **Work Item Types**: Select Jira Work Item Types to be synced.

    <img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-platform/integration/alm/jira-step5.png" alt="Filling in required fields in System Integration UI" width="900"/> <br/>
    #### Step 6: Bug Fields and Values Mapping
    :::caution notes
    This step is enable only if **Pull Requirements and/or Bug Mapping is selected** (Step 2)
    :::
    This section allows you to map the fields and values of bugs to the corresponding fields and values in Katalon TestOps.

    - Map **Jira Severity** levels to your chosen **TestOps Severity** levels based on your workflow.
    
    - Map **Jira Status** levels to your chosen **TestOps Status**. 

    - Select either **Jira Resolution** or **Jira Status** to your chosen TestOps Status.

4. Click **Proceed** to sync data and finalize the connection.  
    - If the status initially shows as **Inactive**, reload the page to update the status to **Active**.  
    - If you modify the connection details and click **Save**, your changes will be saved, but the status may remain **Inactive**. To sync data and finalize the connection, click **Proceed**.

5. [Optional] To edit an existing linked Jira integration, click the **Edit (pen)** icon, make the necessary changes, and click **Proceed**. After editing, reload the page to ensure data is refreshed.

#### Result

Your Jira integration is now active within your project.
