This document shows you how to upload Katalon test reports to Katalon TestOps using Circle CI.

## Prerequisites
- Katalon API key – If you haven’t set one up yet, follow this [guide](/katalon-platform/administer/profile/katalon-api-key-in-katalon-testops) to generate your API key.
- Project ID - You can find your Katalon project ID in the URL (typically after `/project/`, e.g., ".../project/1234567/...").

## Upload test reports using Circle CI

1. Get the local path to your Katalon report folders, e.g. `“C:\Users\alex\Katalon Studio\Web Sample\Reports\Test Suite\20190523_143946"` that you want to upload.

2. Create an `Environment Variable` in your Circle CI configuration for:
```js
KATALON_TESTOPS_APIKEY=your-katalon-api-value
```

3. Copy the following .yml file to your repository that is already synced with Circle CI.

  :::note Warning

    - `PROJECT_ID`: Enter your Katalon Project ID.
    - `TYPE`: Select one of the following options:
      - katalon
      - junit
