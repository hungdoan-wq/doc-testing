This document shows you how to integrate Pytest with Katalon TestOps to upload test reports.

## Prerequisites

- Python (pip3) installed on your machine.
- Katalon API key – If you haven’t set one up yet, follow this [guide](/katalon-platform/administer/profile/katalon-api-key-in-katalon-testops) to generate your API key.
- Project ID - You can find your Katalon project ID in the URL (typically after `/project/`, e.g., ".../project/1234567/...").

## Upload Pytest test reports to Katalon TestOps

:::info
The step-by-step instructions below use a Katalon [sample project](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/testops-pytest-sample) for illustration purposes.
:::

1. **Install dependencies**: Open your source code editor, navigate to your sample project, and run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    pip3 install testops-pytest
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Configure TestOps credentials & project**: 

    a. Create a new file named ```testops-config.json``` in the root directory of your sample project and add the following content:

    ```jsx
    {
        "apiKey": "your_api_key_value",
        "projectId": "your_project_id_value",
        "reportFolder": "testops-report"
    }
    ```

    Replace the placeholder values with your actual details, for example:

    - ``apiKey``: Your Katalon API key (e.g., 1a11111a-1aa1-1a1a-1a1a-a1aaa111111).
    - ``projectId``: Your Katalon project ID (e.g., 1111111).
    - ``reportFolder``: The directory where Pytest will store test report JSON files after execution (default: `testops-report`).

    b. **Add reporter**: Create a file named ``config.py`` in your root directory and add the following content:

    ```jsx
    pytest_plugins = ["testops_pytest.listener", ]
    ```

    c. Configure a proxy **(optional)**: Add the following to `testops-config.json` if a proxy is needed:

    ```jsx
    {
        ...
        "proxy": {
            "protocol": "http or https",
            "host": "your_proxy_host",
            "port": "your_proxy_port",
            "auth": {
                "username": "your_username",
                "password": "your_password"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Run tests and upload reports: Run the command below to run your tests and upload reports to Katalon TestOps:

    ```jsx
    python3 -m pytest
    ```
    Alternatively, if pytest is available globally in your system path, you can simply run:
    ```jsx
    pytest
    ```

## Result

Once the reports are uploaded successfully, navigate to **Reports** to view all the uploaded test reports.
