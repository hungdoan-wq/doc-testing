title: Upgrading to the new TestOps FAQ
---

This document addresses key questions regarding the **upgrade** to the latest version of Katalon TestOps.

## Why is Katalon TestOps moving to a new version?

Katalon TestOps is evolving from basic test scheduling and reporting into a full platform that supports quality management across the entire testing lifecycle—covering planning, execution, collaboration, traceability, and release readiness. This is **not a change to the core product**, but a shift to better support how modern teams scale and collaborate.

To support this, we’re moving to a **user-based licensing** **model** that:

- Allows teams to collaborate without quota limits
- Matches how TestOps is used day-to-day
- Simplifies budgeting and scaling as teams grow
- Offers improved role-based access and audit tracking
- Prepares your investment for future features

This update is designed to help your team scale, collaborate, manage quality more effectively, and unlocks more value as TestOps expands its capabilities.

## I only use KSE, KRE, or TestCloud, what does this mean for me?

Katalon TestOps is **no longer available for free**. However, if you're only using Katalon Studio Enterprise (KSE), Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE), or TestCloud, you will still need to access the TestOps portal to manage your licenses and users for these products.

To support this, Katalon provides **one (1) complimentary Katalon Account Manager** access. This allows limited access to essential **license and user management** features—**without requiring a full TestOps subscription**.

This applies to:

- Organizations that only purchase KSE, KRE, or TestCloud
- Organizations that are currently using only these products

## What is exactly Katalon Account Manager?

The Katalon Account Manager is a default administrative access automatically assigned to certain users in organizations that do **not** have a full TestOps subscription but still use Katalon products such as Katalon Studio Enterprise (KSE), Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE), or TestCloud.

- This access is provided only to licensed users of KSE, KRE, or TestCloud who **do not have a full TestOps subscription**.

- It allows access exclusively to license and user management within the TestOps portal—**not to test execution, reporting, or analytics features**.

### What can the Katalon Account Manager do?

The Account Manager has access to the following account and workspace setup features:

- **Manage the Account**: Update account information, branding, and contact details.
- **Structure the Organization**: Create Organizations and Sub-Organizations.
- **Manage Licenses:** Assign, reassign, and monitor license usage across users and workspaces.
- **Add and Manage Users**: Invite users, assign product access, and define business domains.
- **Configure AI Services**: Enable and manage AI-based capabilities where supported.
- **Manage Select Katalon Studio (KS) Settings:** Access and configure certain KS-related options, though not all KS features are within their control.
- **Configure Platform Settings:** Set up IP whitelisting, custom domains, authentication options, and other workspace-level configurations.

This access ensures the customer can operate and manage user-level functions for Katalon Studio Enterprise and related tools without a TestOps subscription.

### Can this Katalon Account Manager access everything a TestOps Admin can?

**No**, the Katalon Account Manager does not have the same access as a TestOps Admin. Their permissions are limited to managing account-wide settings (such as organization/user management, billing, and licensing management). They **cannot** access TestOps projects, dashboards, test results, or system integrations.

### Can the Katalon Account Manager access project-related features in TestOps?

**No**, the Katalon Account Manager cannot access or manage features related to test activities in TestOps. Their access is limited to account-level settings such as organization/user management, billing, and licensing management . TestOps-specific functions—like test planning, execution, result analysis, or integrations—are not part of the Account Manager’s permissions.

### How is the Account Manager selected?

By default, this Account Manager access is granted to **one of the active KSE licensed users** in the account. It is automatically assigned to the Account Owner from the previous version.

### Can this access be transferred to someone else?

Yes. However, this change must be made by our Support team. Please contact our Support team at: [support@katalon.com](mailto:support@katalon.com) with the name and email of the new user you wish to designate.

### What will happen to my Account Manager access if I later purchase Full TestOps?

Once you purchase Full TestOps, the Account Manager role will no longer be used to manage users, organizations, or licenses. Instead, administrative task, such as managing user roles, system settings, etc, will be handled through the TestOps Admin module.

## Our team was previously using some integrations along with the 2,000 Free Test Results on the old version. What will happen to them?
Here’s what you can expect:

- All of your **historical test data will be retained** in TestOps.
- However, you will **no longer be able to view or access** this data once migrated to the new version, unless you purchase a full TestOps subscription.
- This ensures your data is preserved should you choose to upgrade later.

If your team wishes to continue using TestOps beyond license and user management:  
- You will need to purchase a **full TestOps subscription**.  
- To explore available plans and pricing, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or email us at [success@katalon.com](mailto:success@katalon.com).  
- Our team will review your account setup, discuss the best subscription tier for your needs, and guide you through the next steps.


## How does the new version support SSO and why does it matter for EU customers and small teams?

In the new version, even small customers without Ultimate plans can achieve MFA by:

1. Enabling **SSO (available for all paid accounts)**.
2. Enforcing **MFA at their SSO/IdP level**.

This allows **small EU teams to meet compliance requirements without needing to upgrade to Ultimate**.

## Our team is interested, can I sign up for this upgrade?

If your team is interested in upgrading, please contact us at: [success@katalon.com](mailto:success@katalon.com). We’ll review your account to ensure eligibility and confirm that the upgrade won't disrupt your workflow. Once confirmed, we’ll guide you through the next steps. The upgrade can’t proceed until eligibility is verified.
