<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Publishing plugins allows them to be used by others, who can   access and install them from <span className="ph">Katalon Store</span>.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can publish your plugin publicly so that any Katalon users   can find and install it. In addition to published plugins, you can   also save your plugin as a draft—this lets you test it or   just use it yourself without publishing.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Once you've successfully published a plugin,    on the <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://store.katalon.com/manage/publisher" target="_blank">Published     plugins</a> page, you can continue to:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">Update plugins</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">Remove drafts</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">Publish/Unpublish plugins</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">Manage versions: This feature allows you to update new versions for your       plugins.</p></li></ul>
