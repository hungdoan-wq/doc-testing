title: Windows Desktop app testing on later versions after Katalon Studio 9.7.x
---





Starting from Katalon Studio 10.4.0, **Windows Desktop app testing** is officially available. We are using a new custom driver based on the FlaUI library, which supports **spy**, **record**, and **execution** of test cases—**no separate installation required**.

For more information on feature availability, limitations, and supported application types, see the [Katalon Studio Release Notes: Version 10.x](/katalon-studio/release-notes/katalon-studio-release-notes-version-10.x).

If your projects rely on Windows Desktop app testing, we recommend upgrading to Katalon Studio 10.4.0 and later to access Windows Desktop app testing.
