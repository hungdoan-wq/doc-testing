title: Windows Desktop app testing available with FlaUI in Katalon Studio 10.4.0
---




Starting from version 10.4.0, Katalon Studio's Windows Desktop app testing is officially available.

Due to incompatibility issues between WinAppDriver and Selenium 4, we are now using a new custom driver based on the FlaUI library.

Starting from Katalon Studio 10.4.0, **Windows Desktop app testing** is officially available. We are using a new custom driver based on the FlaUI library, which supports **spy**, **record**, and **execution** of test cases—**no separate installation required**.

For more information on feature availability, limitations, and supported application types, see the [Katalon Studio Release Notes: Version 10.x](/katalon-studio/release-notes/katalon-studio-release-notes-version-10.x).

If your projects rely on Windows Desktop app testing, we recommend upgrading to Katalon Studio 10.4.0 and later to access Windows Desktop app testing.
