## Import BDD custom fields from Jira to Katalon Studio (Applicable to Jira Cloud integration)

Katalon Studio allows you to pull test cases from Jira and link Jira issues to Katalon. Follow these steps:

1. From the Katalon toolbar, select **Jira > Import Test Case** from JIRA JQL. An Import Test Case from JIRA JQL dialog opens.

    <img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-studio/integrations/test-management/jira/KS-TDAP-733-Import-Jira-test-cases-options.png" alt="Import Jira test cases from JQL" width="400" />

2. In the open dialog, fill the JIRA Query Language (JQL) script of the desired test case in the **Jira JQL** box. To find out the JQL script of your test case, you can refer to the Atlassian document here: <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html" target="_blank">Search for issues using JQL</a>.

    For example, we want to import test cases from the **TDAP** project with **Bug** type and **Complete** status. After searching for the Jira ticket using the JQL query, copy and paste the JQL script into the **Jira JQL** box.
    
    <img src="https://tw-cdn.katalon.com/katalon-studio/integrations/test-management/jira/ks-import-jira.png" alt="Import test case from JIRA" width="500" />

3. [Optional] By default, the **Import BDD feature files** box is selected. This option allows you to import BDD feature files to run BDD tests. In case you don't want to run BDD tests, uncheck this option.
4. Click **OK**.
5. The **Test Case Folder Selection** dialog opens. Select the destination to store the issues. Click **OK**.
6. A **Jira Issues** dialog opens. Click **OK** to import the test case from Jira.

    > You can only import test cases from a Jira ticket once. You can not repeat this action.

Once done, you can see a new test case in Katalon Studio with the following information:

* The test case name is the Jira ticket summary/subject.
* The test case description is the Jira ticket content.
* If you select Import BDD feature file as in step 3, Katalon Studio creates a new corresponding feature file in Include/Feature with the following information:
    * The feature file name is the same as the test case name.
    * The scenario in the feature file is the scenario specified in the fetched BDD custom field of the imported Jira ticket.

You can continue to add additional steps in the test case as needed. Then click **Run** for playback.

After importing test cases from Jira to Katalon Studio, you can view test results and submit tickets to Jira.

If you conduct BDD testing, you can view the results in Katalon TestOps. See <a href="/katalon-platform/analyze/reports/view-test-reports/view-bdd-test-results-in-testops">View BDD test results in Katalon TestOps</a>.
