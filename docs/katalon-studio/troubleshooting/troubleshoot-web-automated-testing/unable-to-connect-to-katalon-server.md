#### Remedy

Allow the following .exe files to communicate through Windows Firewall. To learn more about allowing apps through Windows Firewall, you can refer to the Microsoft document here: [Risks of allowing apps through Windows Defender Firewall](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/risks-of-allowing-apps-through-windows-defender-firewall-654559af-3f54-3dcf-349f-71ccd90bcc5c).

- geckodriver.exe
- chromedriver.exe
- iedriverserver.exe

These executable files can be located in: `<Katalon Studio folder>\\configuration\\resources\\drivers`.

You may also need to add Google Chrome (chrome.exe) and Firefox (firefox.exe) in the worst case if your current Windows Firewall blocks them as well.
